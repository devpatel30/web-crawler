Note: The screenshots included in this Registration guide could contain prior term examples of step-by-step Registration processes. Do not confuse the dates you see in the examples in this guide with the actual current term dates and information.  The requirements for advising prior to registration vary according to your program of study. To determine if you require advising refer to the Holds box on your Student Center page or go to your Faculty or Schoolâs advising information page by clicking on the appropriate link below. How to contact your academic advisor: In most cases, you will be assigned an academic advisor for your main plan of study and potentially for any additional plans that you may have. You can easily see the advisor information from the homepage of your student centre: This displays the name of your individual advisor or advising team along with their contact telephone number (if available). If you click on the âdetailsâ link, you will see a breakdown of which advisor or advising team relates to each of your plans. If available, and depending on the email program you are using, you can click on the link where the name of the advisor or advising team is shown. This will allow you to email your advisor. If there is no link, then no email address has been provided and you should use the contact phone number to reach your advisor. NOTE: If you are using an internet email client such as Gmail, you can hover the cursor over the link and the email address will be displayed in the bottom left of your screen. Alternatively, depending on the browser you are using, you can right-click on the link and select âcopy email addressâ. You may then paste the address into your email client. You can also get more information about advising from the links below: Register for courses. You can also find the link to register on to the Student Hub's My CU Account page. If you are on a mobile device or a tablet, click the Enroll tile to begin your registration process. 
 If you are using a desktop, you can access the enrollment functions from the left-hand navigation Enrollment dropdown or by clicking on Enroll on the right. To assist you in planning your timetable we have included information on how to look for courses three different ways: The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. You can search for a range of classes based on specific criteria you can define. This is a comprehensive listing of courses offered at Concordia University. Please note the following: You should consult the Undergraduate Calendar to see the requisites for the course in which you want to register. If you receive a message about ârequisites not metâ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have met all of the requisites as stated in the Undergraduate Calendar. If you believe that you have then you will need to speak to your department (JMSB students, please contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office) so that they can look into this matter for you. Some classes have seats reserved for students in specific programs. This is usually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program can register in it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers the class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats as reserved. If you try to register for a class and receive a message about âreserved seatsâ then you should select another class or consult the department or the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office, for JMSB students to obtain permission to take the class.
 Some classes may require that you first obtain department permission to take the class. If you receive a message that states: âDepartment Consent Requiredâ, you will need to speak to the department that offers the class to obtain permission to register. JMSB students will need to contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. Note that the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to add courses directly to your enrollment course cart. You will then need to follow the instructions further down this page in Step 6A â Adding Classes. You can access the Concordia Class Schedule Builder from four different places in your student centre: Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the âclass schedule builderâ link shown in the image below. Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the âSEARCH FOR CLASSESâ button on the top right of the page. 
On the Search for Classes page, click the âSEARCH WITH CLASS SCHEDULE BUILDERâ button. Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Then either click the âEnrollâ or âenrollment course cartâ links. Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE. 
Once in the enrollment course cart, select the âClass Schedule Builderâ option (shown below) and click âsearchâ. Log into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre.  Select the âClass Scheduleâ option from the drop-down list in the Academics section.  Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE. 
On the âMy Class Scheduleâ page, select the âView in Class Schedule Builderâ option at the top right. The Search for classes function is used to look for information about scheduled classes for a particular term and is generally available in early March. A variety of search criteria may be entered to narrow or broaden a search. Search results provide information such as date and time of classes, location, name of instructor, number of seats available and so on. To search for classes: For a Summer class, select âSummer 2023â
 For a Fall class, select âFall 2023â
 For a Winter class, select âWinter 2024â
 For a Fall / Winter class, select âFall/Winter 2023-24â (6 credit FULL YEAR classes only)
 To view classes in all terms of the academic year, select âALL TERMS (2023-2024) NOTE: Any terms in the list that end in â(CCE Only)â will only return results for Continuing Education classes. . There are three modes of instruction at Concordia: In Person â In Person courses are taught in-person on a Concordia campus. On-Line â On-line courses are taught online and not in a classroom setting. Blended Learning â Blended Learning courses are a combination of in-class and online learning. Class times, locations and specific dates listed in Days/Times and Start/End Date fields will indicate which in-class meetings are required. For more information, please see the notes tab or contact the department. The Browse Course Catalog feature provides access to a comprehensive listing of information about courses offered at Concordia University.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search > Browse Course Catalog To browse for courses: Important Note:  the existence of a course on this list does not guarantee that the course is currently offered. The enrollment appointment date is the first date on which you may begin the registration process for that term. Your individual date will be displayed in the Enrollment Dates box on your Student Center page. Example: Although the enrollment appointment dates indicate when you will be able to start registering, you can start planning and filling your Course Cart in early March.  The enrollment appointment date is based on the number of credits to completion for your program if you are a degree student. If you wish to calculate your enrollment appointment date, the following formula is used: Program length (minimum credits required) minus credits earned minus in progress courses as of February (excluding DISC courses) equals credits to completion. Following are all the enrollment appointment dates for 2023-24: Newly admitted undergraduate students registering for Fall 2023 (term number 2232), Fall/Winter 2023-24 (term number 2233) and Winter 2024 (term number 2234) terms. Returning and newly authorized undergraduate Independent students for Fall 2023 (term number 2232). On the enrollment appointment dates, the system is programmed to be available from 8 a.m. onward. The registration system may be extremely busy at 8 a.m. on each new enrollment appointment date.    NAVIGATION:  Academics > My Academics
 If the information concerning your program is incorrect you may contact 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 to find out how to make corrections. It is important for this information to be correct, as the wrong degree or concentration may block you from entering courses for which you are eligible. You can add classes to your schedule for the selected term in three easy steps with a couple of restrictions to note:    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Add Find a class to add, using one of the options displayed, or, if you know the class number, enter it into the Enter Class Nbr field Class Search â refer to Step 3 B â Use the Class Search above if you need further help. To view details of the course, click on the Section to obtain further information about the course. If satisfied that you wish to enroll in this course, choose âselectâ. Confirm the class information. If the section selected also requires you to register for additional components such as labs, tutorials, conferences, etc. you will be required to make that choice before proceeding further: Once you have selected the conference, press Next.  You will receive confirmation that the course has been added to your Course Cart. At this point, you may continue to add further courses to your Course Cart. Once you have added all your required courses, you will need to click on the âProceed To Step 2 of 3â button. If your registration was successful you will see the following message: If it was unsuccessful, you will receive an error explaining what the problem is and what you must do to rectify the situation. Here is just one possible example: For Example, the above message is informing you that Departmental Consent is required before you can register in this course. It would be necessary for you to contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent. In other instances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to have seats available. This is caused by the Department/Faculty having reserved seats for students in a particular department or program of study. Remember to register for all terms Summer, Fall, Fall/Winter and Winter at the same time â do not wait until later in the Fall to register for your Winter courses as you may find them filled to capacity. Please note: If you only want to change sections of the same course, see Step 6, C â Swapping classes. There are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are two different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline dates shown in the Term Dates and Deadlines. Please note the following important details:    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Drop Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table. Click the Continue button. All registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. Multi-component classes will display all registered sections. Select the class(es) you want to drop and click the Drop Selected Classes button. Note that you can drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so. Select the My class Schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) are no longer shown OR if they are, that they correctly show the status as Dropped or DSC. You can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. The process is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available.  DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course. There are some restrictions attached to swapping classes: To swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA for HIST 202 Lec A, Conf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping Multi-Component Classes.
    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Swap Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Click the Continue button. The first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled. The next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the Class Nbr if you already know it. Select the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid. Select the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid. If you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the âselect classâ button and you are then re-directed to the Confirm your selection page. If you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option takes you to the Confirm your selection page. If you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the Confirm your selection page. Confirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button. If the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar: View My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction: Once all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list. Academic departments have the choice of offering wait list seats or not. To determine which courses will allow you to add your name to a wait list:    NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search You are now on the Class Detail page which indicates whether a Wait List is available for the course selected and it is also indicated what the wait list capacity is for the course and the Wait List total. This tells you that 80 students can add their name to a wait list after the class capacity of 770 has been reached. There are two scenarios under which you may add your name to a wait list. You start the registration process by trying to register for ECON 201 but the course is full and you get the following error message: You use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and determine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to add your name. Knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box labelled Wait list if class is full and select next. You will see the resulting message: If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. If you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have already reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering INTE 123, you would use the Swap This Class grid to identify which of your courses you would swap. You would then go to the With This Class grid and enter the course. You will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you identify that you want to âWait list if class is fullâ. If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Note: Adding your name to a waitlist does NOT guarantee that you will get into the class. You can verify your schedule in two different formats. From your Student Center page you can choose weekly schedule. The resulting âMy Class Scheduleâ page allows you to select the term for which you wish to verify your registrations. After selecting the term, press continue. You then have the choice of seeing your schedule in a list view or a weekly calendar view. The list view is as follows: The weekly calendar view is as follows: PLEASE NOTE:
